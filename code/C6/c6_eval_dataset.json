While the exact content of the box is not detailed in the provided context, marine birds and mammals are generally highly sensitive to environmental changes due to their ecological roles, life history traits, and dependence on specific habitats. Here are plausible reasons for their vulnerability, inferred from the broader context of the chapter:\n\n1. **Dependence on Specific Habitats**: Marine birds and mammals often rely on particular oceanic conditions (e.g., sea ice, upwelling zones, or coastal ecosystems) for breeding, feeding, and migration. Climate-driven changes like warming, acidification, or sea ice loss could disrupt these critical habitats.\n\n2. **Trophic Sensitivity**: Many marine birds and mammals are apex predators or depend on specific prey species. Climate impacts on lower trophic levels (e.g., fish, plankton) can cascade upward, affecting their food availability.\n\n3. **Behavioral and Physiological Constraints**: These species may have limited capacity to adapt rapidly to changing conditions due to slow reproductive rates, long lifespans, or specialized diets, making them less resilient to abrupt environmental shifts.\n\n4. **Exposure to Multiple Stressors**: As highlighted in Sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.5, interactions between multiple drivers (e.g., warming, deoxygenation, and pollution) may compound risks for marine birds and mammals, exacerbating population declines.\n\n5. **Migration and Phenology Mismatches**: Climate change can alter the timing of prey availability or migration routes, leading to mismatches that threaten survival and reproductive success.\n\nGiven the chapter's focus on \"ecological responses to multiple drivers\" (Section 3.3.5) and \"cross-cutting changes\" (Section 3.4.3), Box 3.2 likely emphasizes these interconnected vulnerabilities.
