# RAG Introduction

## What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to enhance the capabilities of large language models. It allows models to access and utilize external knowledge sources during the generation process.

## Key Components

1. **Retrieval System**: Searches for relevant information from external knowledge bases
2. **Generation Model**: Uses retrieved information to generate more accurate and informative responses
3. **Knowledge Base**: External source of information (documents, databases, etc.)

## Benefits of RAG

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Access to up-to-date and domain-specific information
- **Reduced Hallucination**: Grounding responses in factual data
- **Scalability**: Can work with large knowledge bases
- **Flexibility**: Easy to update knowledge without retraining models

## Applications

- Question Answering Systems
- Document Summarization
- Knowledge-based Chatbots
- Research Assistance Tools

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll explore how to implement RAG systems step by step, starting with the preparation of your development environment.
